Krouton provides a routing API for [HTTP4K](https://http4k.org), but the core abstractions can be used with any web server library.


## Examples

* [Routing and reverse routing with HTTP4K](src/test/kotlin/com/natpryce/krouton/example/HttpRoutingExample.kt)


## Principles

Type safe routing and reverse routing.

No reflection, annotations or classpath scanning.

Explicit, type-checked flow of data and control, instead of "spooky action at a distance" via reflection, annotations,
classpath scanning, passing data in context maps or synthetic HTTP headers, or control flow via exceptions.

Separate code that routes and handles requests from definitions of URLs

* URLs defined by constants (immutable objects)
* Routing policy defined by operations on those constants
* Routing done by functions/closures/objects that connect Krouton's routing policy API to a web server library.

Compositional: routes are composed from primitive parts and composition operators. User-defined routes can be used in
exactly the same way as the predefined primitives.

Mandatory aspects of a resource locator go in the path

Query parameters are optional and are interpreted by the resource.


## Routing policy operations

* Parsing: `UrlScheme<T>.parse(String) -> T?`
* Reverse Routing: `UrlScheme<T>.path(T) -> String`
* Reporting: `UrlScheme<T>.monitoredPath(T)-> String`


## Route composition

* Append:
    * `UrlScheme<T> + UrlScheme<U> -> UrlScheme<Tuple2<T,U>>`
    * `+` operator supports appending paths for scalars and tuples, forming paths for tuples with up to five elements
    * `UrlScheme<Unit> + UrlScheme<T> -> UrlScheme<T>`
    * `UrlScheme<T> + UrlScheme<Unit> -> UrlScheme<T>`
* Append fixed path element: `UrlScheme<T> + String -> UrlScheme<T>`
* Restrict: `UrlScheme<T> where ((T)->Boolean) -> UrlScheme<T>`
* Project: `UrlScheme<T> asA Projection<T,U> -> UrlScheme<U>`


## What's with the version number?

The version number is {mental}.{major}.{minor}.{patch}. The last three digits are treated as a
[semantic version number](https://semver.org). The first digit is incremented if there is a significant
change in the mental model underpinning the library. A major version of zero always signifies a pre-release version,
irrespective of the value of the first digit. The API of pre-release versions may go through significant changes in
response to user feedback before the release of version x.1.0.0.
